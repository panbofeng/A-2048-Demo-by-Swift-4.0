# A-2048-Demo-by-Swift-4.0
## Verison 1.1:
1. added game over hint and solved the deadlock problems.
2. added restart button so that you can restart the game in the app directly.

## Verison 1.0:
Basic 2048 implementation.

## Known bugs and comming next:
1. no game over hint so that causes some deadlock problems.
2. the top score label has no implementation in verison 1.0.
3. no restart button.
4. no game level selection buttons.
5. no animation(will not be added in next few verisons).
